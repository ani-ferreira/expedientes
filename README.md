## General Information

Inside the workflow of a law firm, it can happen (if they are working on many cases) that they lose track of the status of each one.

In some of those law firms, updates are normally recorded in writing or saving data in several excel sheets, but these methods can be very slow and cumbersome when the amount of work increases.

This web app would allow them to have all the updates they need in one place, plus it is very easy and intuitive to use.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run `npm run dev` to start the application. You will then be able to access it at localhost:3000.

## Room for Improvement

To do:

- Add a datepicker to the form that displays a calendar along with a date input field
- Display some message for the user to know they are logged out (when JWT expires). At the moment they are just being redirected to login page.
